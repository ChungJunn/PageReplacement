1. This programming exercise is to practice implementing different page replacement algorithms, and comparing their performance by comparing number of page faults
	1) FIFO
	2) LRU
	3) Optimal pg replacement

2. given conditions are the following:
	1) page reference string
		- randomized int string
		- their length is set to 30
	2) record the number of page fault
	
	3) page frames
		- their number var from 1 to 7

3. important notes
	1) concerning pageReferenceString
		- its type is char string
		- be advised that page reference is always in range 0-9
		- the numbers are stroed as char

4. approach - How am I gonna do this exercise?
	1) break down the problem
		initially, only think about one algorithm for implementation. that is, I will consider each algorithm as separate problem. I will not think about solving them together.
